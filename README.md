# Project: Security Operations Center (SOC)
# Overview
The goal of this project is to create an automated solution for security monitoring, detection, and response. By leveraging open-source tools, the objective is to streamline incident management and improve the overall security posture.
# Tools Used:
**Suricata**: Network intrusion detection.

**Wazuh**: SIEM and XDR

**Graylog**: Log management and real-time analysis.

**OpenCTI**: Threat Intelligence for threat analysis.

**TheHive & Cortex**: Incident management and automation.

**Shuffle**: SOAR platform

**Volweb**: Forensic analysis of incidents.

# Project Objectives:
- Automation: Streamline detection and response processes to enhance efficiency.


- Continuous Improvement: Build a scalable and flexible infrastructure for ongoing security enhancement.


- Cost Reduction: Utilize open-source solutions to minimize expenses while ensuring high-quality security

# Benefits:
- Enhanced detection and faster response to incidents.

- Continuous learning and adaptation to emerging threats.

- Cost-effective security infrastructure through open-source tools.

# ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

- Git installed to clone the repository.

 # Technical requirements:

- Total RAM: 16 to 32 GB (to support all VMs running simultaneously, with a buffer for handling peak loads).
- Processor: 8 to 12 physical cores to ensure smooth performance, depending on network load and log processing.
- Total Storage: 300 to 500 GB minimum (depending on log retention, analytical data, and incident files).
