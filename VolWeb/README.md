# Introduction

**VolWeb** is a digital forensic memory analysis platform that leverages the **Volatility 3** framework. It is designed to assist with investigations and incident response by providing a centralized, visual web application for memory forensics. Once a memory image is obtained from a system (Linux or Windows), it can be uploaded to VolWeb for automatic processing and artifact extraction.

VolWeb enhances the efficiency of memory collection and forensic analysis by streamlining the process and providing hybrid storage solutions to assist investigators and digital forensics experts.

**Note:** VolWeb is a complementary tool to Volatility 3. It offers a visual alternative for reviewing and investigating results but does not replace in-depth memory analysis.

## üß¨ Objectives

The main objectives of VolWeb are:
- To simplify and centralize memory forensics with Volatility 3.
- To provide enhanced web features for digital forensics experts and incident response professionals.
- To enable hybrid storage of evidence, allowing analysis both locally and on cloud storage solutions.
- To facilitate the export of technical information (indicators) to modern CTI platforms such as **OpenCTI** and **MISP**.
